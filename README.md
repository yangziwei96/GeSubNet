# GeSubNet.

This is an official implementation of paper (ICLR 2025 Oral), "GeSubNet: Gene Interaction Inference for Disease Subtype Network Generation". 

# Dependencies:
GeSubNet is built based on PyTorch.
You can install PyTorch following the instructions in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). For example:

```bash
pip install torch==1.10.0+cu111 torchvision==0.11.0+cu111 torchaudio==0.10.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```
After ensuring that PyTorch is installed correctly, you can install other dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# About data:
We have prepared datasets for four cancers: BRCA, GBM, OV, and LGG. The dataset is in the in the directory ```./data/```.

# Training:
For GeSubNet:
The main code is ```./GeSubNet_main.py```.

The available models for Patient-M and Graph-M are in the directory ```./model/```.

The utils needed for training are ```./utils.py```.

Log files will be generated and updated in  ```./log/``` during the training process.

# Case Analysis:
More results of the BRCA case analysis are in the directory ```./Case Analysis/```.
